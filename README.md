# dna-vue

** No longer being updated! **
New version at https://github.com/tehdarthvid/dna-vue.

Personal influence DNA project for ReactJS study.

Substantial stable progress should eventually goto: https://dna.darthvid.com/

Initial version was Vue based (https://github.com/tehdarthvid/old-dna), mainly derived from https://vuejsexamples.com/parallax-depth-cards-with-vue-js/. Then I re-implemented it in ReactJS to learn React/Redux (https://github.com/tehdarthvid/dna-react). Now, I moved it back to VueJS/Vuex so I can compare the two. :)

Just playing around to study. You'll find the code gets dirty. That's because on this project I'm playin' around, tryin' stuff out! It gets messy, mistakes are made, then you figure it out, clean-up, and hopefully, you'll you'll end up bein' better.

Files in the project started from "vue init webpack my-project" (https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#CLI).
